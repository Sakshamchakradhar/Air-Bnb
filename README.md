### Project Overview
**Project Airbnb** is a comprehensive platform designed for property listings and reviews, created using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure a clean separation of data, interface, and business logic. The application integrates user authentication, role-based access control, dynamic content management, and interactive reviews for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. MVC Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Developed following the MVC framework to streamline the codebase and enhance maintainability. Clear separation between data models, user interfaces, and business logic enables easy updates and scalability.

### 2. User Authentication & Authorization
- **Secure Access**: Integrated Passport.js to handle user authentication, ensuring secure sign-up, login, and role-based access. Route protection safeguards critical functionalities for property owners and reviewers.
- **Authorization Roles**: Configured role-based access, distinguishing between regular users and property owners, ensuring controlled access to listing and review functions.

- **Property Listings**: Developed a complete CRUD system for property listings, allowing property owners to create, view, update, and delete listings.
- **Image Uploads**: Utilized Multer for seamless image uploads, with cloud storage through MongoDB Atlas for scalable and secure data handling.
- **Enhanced Listings**: Listings include descriptions, amenities, and images for a richer user experience.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings

### 5. Data Validation & Error Handling
- **Data Validation**: Leveraged Joi for robust schema-based validation, ensuring all data inputs meet the necessary requirements.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Created custom middleware to manage and display error messages via flash notifications, enhancing user feedback and guiding interactions.

### 6. Responsive UI Design
- **Device Compatibility**: Built with Bootstrap to create a responsive, intuitive interface that adapts to a variety of screen sizes and devices.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Designed an easy-to-navigate layout, providing clear paths for users to explore listings, post reviews, and manage their profiles.

### 7. MongoDB Database Integration
- **Database Design**: Designed and managed schemas for property listings and reviews, ensuring data is efficiently organized for quick access and relationships are well-defined.
- **Mongoose ORM**: Used Mongoose for smooth interactions with MongoDB, allowing for streamlined querying and data manipulation.

### 8. Custom Middleware
- **Session Management**: Implemented middleware for managing user sessions and authentication status.
- **Authorization & Validation**: Developed middleware to handle role-based access control and data validation checks, ensuring only authorized users can access or modify content.

### 9. Version Control & Deployment
- **Git & GitHub**: Managed source code with Git and GitHub, ensuring version control and collaborative development.
- **Deployment on Render**: Deployed the application on Render, with environment variables for secure integration of cloud storage and MongoDB Atlas, enhancing security.

### 10. Future Enhancements
